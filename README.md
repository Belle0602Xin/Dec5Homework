Student–Teacher Relationship Demo (Spring Boot + H2)

This is a small Spring Boot project that manages students and teachers with a many-to-many relationship.

The goal of this assignment is to:
Create tables manually using SQL (schema.sql)
Initialize some data using data.sql
Use Spring Data JPA as ORM
Expose REST APIs to create, read, update, delete students
Manage the relationship between students and teachers (assign, change, remove)
Be able to explain the code, tables, and queries clearly in a demo
